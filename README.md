# Dynamic Account Demo

This repository contains an end-2-end implementation of a dApp that implements a [Safe](https://safe.global/) - like multisig wallet
with the new account abstraction protocol feature of [IOTA](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota).

> [!WARNING]
> The dApp is intended solely for showcasing the capabilities of the new protocol feature and by no means considered safe to use in
any production environment.
